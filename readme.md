# Project Title

Pendulum Project: Simulating and gathering real data to analyse the properties of a pendulum.

## Description

For this project, we constructed a pendulum out of legos and used a microbit to obtain values for acceleration. We wrote these values on a text file for the microbit and calculated the position of the pendulum based on its acceleration.

## Instructions

In order to initially get your data, run "sensor_data.py" in Mu.

For the simulation part, run "pendulum_project.py" in Spyder, which produces plots for a simulated pendulum that can be analysed. 

For the data collection part, run "data_parsing.py" in Spyder, which produces plots with our real world data that can be analysed.

For data_parsing.py, use the text file data_697.txt to get an example of our data.
